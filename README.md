# Predictive-Analytics-for-Hospital-Resource-Management

This project aims to make hospital resource management smarter and more efficient using predictive analytics. Our dashboard provides real-time insights into key resources like bed availability, ICU capacity, and staff allocation, while leveraging machine learning models to forecast future needs. Whether you're a hospital administrator or a data enthusiast, this tool will help you make informed decisions. It also includes a simple user login and signup system for access control.

# Features
Live Dashboard: Get real-time updates on hospital resources (beds, staff, ICU availability).
Predictive Insights: Use machine learning to forecast resource needs.
User Authentication: Secure login and sign-up pages to manage access.
Interactive Charts: Visualize data trends with dynamic charts (thanks to Chart.js).
Mobile-Friendly Design: Access the dashboard on any device.
Tech Stack

# Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap (for responsive layouts).
Backend: Python with Flask (manages the server-side logic).
Data Visualization: Chart.js for beautiful, interactive charts.
Machine Learning: Our forecasting models use ARIMA, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Linear Programming for resource optimization.


# How It Works
Login or Sign Up: Start by signing up or logging in to access the dashboard.
Real-time Monitoring: View metrics like available/occupied beds, ICU capacity, and staff availability.
Predictive Analytics: Our machine learning models predict future resource demands based on past data.
Optimize: Use our recommendations to allocate resources more efficiently and keep the hospital running smoothly.

# Machine Learning Models

ARIMA: Ideal for time-series forecasting (e.g., predicting bed availability over time).
XGBoost: A powerful algorithm that helps us fine-tune predictions.
Decision Tree: It helps us make decisions about resource allocation based on different factors.
Linear Programming: It optimizes resource scheduling and allocation.
